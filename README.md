## Installation

TestProject SDK for C# is available via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TestProject.SDK).

* Right-click the project and select `Manage NuGet Packages...`
* Search for `TestProject SDK` and add it to your project.

# Test Development

A test class has to implement **one** of the following interfaces:

```ascii
TestProject.SDK.Tests
├── IWebTest
├── IAndroidTest
└── IIOSTest
```

Here is an example of creating & running a test class implementing the `IWebTest` interface. \
This test performs a login and expects a logout button to appear:

```csharp
using OpenQA.Selenium;
using TestProject.Common.Attributes;
using TestProject.Common.Enums;
using TestProject.SDK;
using TestProject.SDK.Tests;
using TestProject.SDK.Tests.Helpers;

namespace MyFirstExample
{
  public class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      using (Runner runner = new RunnerBuilder("YOUR-DEV-TOKEN")
            .AsWeb(AutomatedBrowserType.Chrome).Build())
      {
        runner.Run(new BasicTest());
      }
    }

    [Test(Name="Basic Test")]
    class BasicTest : IWebTest
    {
      public ExecutionResult Execute(WebTestHelper helper)
      {
        // Get driver initialized by TestProject Agent
        // No need to specify browser type, it can be done later via UI
        var driver = helper.Driver;

        driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("https://example.testproject.io/web/");

        driver.FindElementByCssSelector("#name").SendKeys("John Smith");
        driver.FindElementByCssSelector("#password").SendKeys("12345");
        driver.FindElementByCssSelector("#login").Click();

        if (driver.FindElements(By.CssSelector("#logout")).Count > 0)
          return ExecutionResult.Passed;
        return ExecutionResult.Failed;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* [Web](Web/Test/TestProject.SDK.Examples.Web.Test/Test/BasicTest.cs) test executed on [TestProject Demo](https://example.testproject.io/web/index.html) website.
* [Android](Android/Test/TestProject.SDK.Examples.Android.Test/Test/BasicTest.cs) test executed on [TestProject Demo](https://github.com/testproject-io/android-demo-app) App for Android.
* [iOS](IOS/Test/Test/BasicTest.cs) test executed on [TestProject Demo](https://github.com/testproject-io/ios-demo-app) App for iOS.

## Test Running

To debug or run the test, you will have to use the **Runner** class. \
Here' is an `NUnit` example that executes the `BasicTest` shown above:

```csharp
using NUnit.Framework;
using TestProject.Common.Enums;
using TestProject.SDK.Examples.Web.Runners.Nunit.Base;

namespace TestProject.SDK.Examples.Runners.Nunit
{
  public class BasicTests
  {
    Runner runner;

    [OneTimeSetUp]
    public void SetUp()
    {
      runner = new RunnerBuilder(DevToken).AsWeb(AutomatedBrowserType.Chrome).Build();
    }

    [Test]
    public void TestLogin()
    {
      runner.Run(new BasicTest());
    }

    [OneTimeTearDown]
    public void TearDown()
    {
      runner.Dispose();
    }
  }
}
```

Below are examples for initialization of other Runner types:

**Desktop Web**
```csharp
var runner = new RunnerBuilder("DEV_TOKEN")
	.AsWeb(AutomatedBrowserType...).Build();
```

**Android**

```csharp
var runner = new RunnerBuilder("DEV_TOKEN")
	.AsAndroid("DEVICE_UDID", "APP_PACKAGE", "ACTIVITY").Build();
```

**Chrome on Android**

```csharp
var runner = new RunnerBuilder("DEV_TOKEN")
	.AsAndroidWeb("DEVICE_UDID").Build();
```

**iOS**

```csharp
var runner = new RunnerBuilder("DEV_TOKEN")
	.AsIOS("DEVICE_UDID", "DEVICE_NAME", "APP_BUNDLE_ID").Build();
```

**Safari on iOS**

```csharp
var runner = new RunnerBuilder("DEV_TOKEN")
	.AsIOSWeb("IOS_DEVICE_ID", "IOS_DEVICE_NAME").Build();
```

## Reports

TestProject SDK reports all driver commands and their results to the TestProject Cloud. \
Doing so, allows us to present beautifully designed reports and statistics in our dashboards.

Reports can be completely disabled via `RunnerBuilder`, for example:

```csharp
var runner = new RunnerBuilder("DEV_TOKEN")
	.WithReportsDisabled()
	.AsWeb(AutomatedBrowserType...)
	.Build();
```

There are more options to disable reporting of specific entities. \
See [Disabling Reports](#disabling-reports) section for more information.

## Implicit Project and Job Names

The SDK will attempt to infer Project and Job names from NUnit / MSTest / XUnit attributes. \
If found, the following logic and priorities take place:

* _Namespace_ of the class where the `Runner` is created, is used for **Project** name.
* _Class_ name where the `Runner` is created, is used for the **Job** name.
* _Test class_ name, or the _Name_ property of the `Test` attribute on the class is used for the **Test** name.
  
Examples of implicit Project & Job names inferred from annotations:
* [NUnit example](Web/Test/TestProject.SDK.Examples.Web.Test/Runners/Nunit/DesktopTests.cs)
* [Console Program example](Web/Test/TestProject.SDK.Examples.Web.Test/Runners/Console/Program.cs)

## Explicit Names

Project and Job names can be also specified explicitly using the relevant options in `RunnerBuilder`, for example:

```csharp
var runner = new RunnerBuilder("DEV_TOKEN")
	.WithProjectName("My First Project")
	.WithJobName("My First Job")
	.AsWeb(AutomatedBrowserType...)
	.Build();
```

You can specify a Project, a Job name or both. If you don't, the value will be inferred automatically. \
See [Implicit Project and Job Names](#implicit-project-and-job-names) section for more information on how these names are inferred.

Examples of explicit Project & Job names configuration:
* [NUnit example](Web/Test/TestProject.SDK.Examples.Web.Test/Runners/Nunit/ExplicitNameTests.cs)
## Tests Reports

### Tests Reporting

Tests are reported automatically when a test **ends**, in other works, when `Runner.Run()` method execution ends.\
Test names are inferred from the `[Test]` attribute's _Name_ property if it is present, or from the test class name.

> This behavior can't be overridden or disabled at this time.

Each call to `Runner.Run` will create a separate test in a job report. \
Even calls in the same testing framework method behave this way.

For example, following NUnit based code, will generate the following _four_ tests in the report:

```csharp
  class Test : IWebTest
  {
    [Parameter] public string url;


    public ExecutionResult Execute(WebTestHelper helper)
    {
      helper.Driver.Navigate().GoToUrl(url);
      return ExecutionResult.Passed;
    }
  }
  
  class TestRunner {

    Runner runner;

    TestRunner()
    {
      runner = new RunnerBuilder("DevToken")
        .AsWeb(AutomatedBrowserType.Chrome).Build();
    }

    [Test]
    public void RunGoogle()
    {
      var test = new Test() {url = "http://www.google.com"};
      runner.Run(test);
    }

    [Test]
    public void RunTestProject()
    {
      var test = new Test() {url = "http://testproject.io"};
      runner.Run(test);
    }

    [Test]
    public void RunAll()
    {
      var test = new Test() {url = "http://www.google.com"};
      runner.Run(test);
      test = new Test() {url = "http://testproject.io"};
      runner.Run(test);
    }

    [OneTimeTearDown]
    public void TearDown()
    {
      runner.Dispose();
    }
  }
```

Report:

```ascii
Report
├── RunGoogle
│   └── Navigate To https://google.com/
├── RunTestProject
│   └── Navigate To http://testproject.io
└── RunAll
    ├── Navigate To https://google.com/
    └── Navigate To http://testproject.io
```

### Steps

Steps are reported automatically when driver commands are executed. \
Even if this feature is disabled, or in addition, steps can still be reported **manually**

Notice the following line in the [Extended Test](Web/Test/TestProject.SDK.Examples.Web.Test/Test/ExtendedTest.cs) example. \
This line reports a step based on provided condition and takes a screenshot:

```csharp
helper.Reporter.Step("Profile information saved", profilePage.Saved, TakeScreenshotConditionType.Always);
```

Using the following code one can set test result message:

```csharp
report.Result = "Test completed successfully";
```

## Disabling Reports

Reporting can be disabled during Runner creation.\
If reporting was explicitly disabled when the runner was created, it can **not** be enabled later.

### Disable all reports

The following will create a runner with all types of reports disabled (except manual step reports):

```csharp
var runner = new RunnerBuilder("DEV_TOKEN")
	.WithReportsDisabled()
	.Build();
```

### Disable driver commands reports

Disabling commands reporting will result in tests reports with no steps, unless they are reported manually using `helper.Reporter.step()`.
The following will disable driver _commands_ reporting: 

```csharp
var runner = new RunnerBuilder("DEV_TOKEN")
	.WithDriverCommandReportingDisabled()
	.Build();
```

## Custom capabilities

You can set custom capabilities that will be used by selenium/appium when opening the session. \
Please note that you can't override basic options like `browserName` using this technique

```csharp
using OpenQA.Selenium;
using TestProject.SDK;
using TestProject.Common.Enums;

var options = new ChromeOptions();
// Setting custom capability - Headless Chrome
options.AddArguments("--headless");

using (var runner = new RunnerBuilder("MY_TOKEN")
	.AsWeb(AutomatedBrowserType.Chrome)
	.WithOptions(options)
	.Build())
```
